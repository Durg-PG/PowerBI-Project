# PowerBI-Project
I recently came across the tool called Power BI
It's a open source platform by Microsoft which is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization.

Microsoft Power BI works by connecting data sources and providing a dashboard of business intelligence to the users. It can connect with just an Excel spreadsheet or bring together cloud-based and on-premises data warehouses. Data pulled from cloud-based sources

Power BI offers data preparation and discovery, interactive dashboards and rich visualisations in one solution, and its self-service capabilities make it an intuitive tool for interacting with data and turning it into insights more easily



So I decided to try my hands on it
So here's my interactive Dashboard about the sales of products around the globe.
It's a sample dataset which I imported from kaggle
